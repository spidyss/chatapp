This architecture combines the strengths of Redis PubSub, Kafka, and PostgreSQL to create a scalable and real-time socket application on the Aiven cloud. The use of managed services ensures efficient resource utilization and simplifies the deployment and management of the infrastructure. The resulting application is robust, scalable, and well-equipped to handle real-time communication in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner.
